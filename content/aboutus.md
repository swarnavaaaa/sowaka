  - title: Rutvi Muley
    answer: I am Rutvi Muley, a Counselling Psychologist currently under supervision. My practice inclines towards a Rogerian approach, while I place importance on the "being" of the client, as well as myself in the chair of a therapist. I work well with adolescents and young adults. I have a Master's degree in Counselling Psychology, and I additionally gather knowledge and awareness of basics from courses like Trauma-informed Therapy, Couples Therapy, Queer Affirmative Therapy, and borrow from modalities of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy and Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy. <br/> Inspired by Freudian theories and therapists, I also hold space for subconscious matter to show up in a session, and greet it with unconditional curiosity. As a budding Psychologist I hope to welcome conversations about clients' experience with me as their therapist, and encourage them to bring it up to facilitate a realistic therapist-client relationship.
